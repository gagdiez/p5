## Small Coding Challenges using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/)

This repository contains small coding challenges using the [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. The challenges are based on the [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) YouTube channel.

> [!INFO]
> To run any project you will need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.
> After installing node.js, you can run the following command to start the project:
> `npm install`
> `npm start`

### Sand Simulations
Different sand simulations using P5.js. Based on the [Challenge 180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4u7Zy_b868)

- [Sand](./sand): A simple sand falling simulation. The grains fall following a constant speed and accumulate on the ground.

- [Sand with Acceleration](./sand-acc): A sand falling simulation with acceleration. The grains accelerate as they fall.

- [Sand with Acceleration and Alpha](./sand-acc-alpha): 
A sand falling simulation were grains accelerate and leave a trail behind
